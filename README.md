# Static-Object-Detection

The projects helps us to identify any suspicious object kept in front of the object for more than a certain amount of time and is not being noticed. We can set few of the objects as target object which have higher probabillity of being suspicious in my case I have considered bottle as target object.


When the object is kept in front of the camera
